# Linux Commands Research - Exercise 2

For this exercise, I researched 10 additional Linux commands not covered in the module.  
I created a folder in my `altschool-cloud-exercises` project containing:

- A markdown file explaining each command briefly.
- Usage examples for each command.
- Screenshots demonstrating each command in action.

All images are embedded in the markdown files to provide clear visual references.  
This submission showcases my understanding and practical usage of these Linux commands.
