# Exercise 1: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Setup with Vagrant

I have successfully set up an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS virtual machine using Vagrant on my local machine.  
In the `Vagrantfile`, I customized the network settings to use a private network with DHCP, ensuring the VM receives an IP address automatically.

Once the VM was up and running, I accessed it via the terminal and ran the `ifconfig` command to check the network interfaces and IP configuration.

Both the `Vagrantfile` and the output of `ifconfig` are included in this submission folder for your review.
